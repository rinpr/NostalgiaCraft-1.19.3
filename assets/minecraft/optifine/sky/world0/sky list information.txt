These files are used to solve a bug that occurs with Optifine:
When using a custom sky such as sky0 (assets\minecraft\optifine\colormap\sky0),
the sky becomes too saturated when it rains, snows or when there is thunder.

rain.png, thunder.png, rainwarm.png, thunderwarm.png, raincold.png and thundercold.png restore the classic sky color.
